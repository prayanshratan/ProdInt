This should either be framed in terms of user actions and expected results or alternatively a logical articulation of the workflows that comprise this feature. The goal of this section is to ensure that if 10 people read this section, they have a reasonably similar understanding of what needs to be built. That is the level of precision that we should be shooting for in this section.\n\n\n\nYou can also use this space to describe what is *not* in scope. This may be important to ensure the project does not get too large and slip out of the targeted release.\n\n\n\nFor mobile team or mobile project:  (a) Version dependency on which cluster version (if not dependent then mention not dependent) (b) Feature available on both on-prem and SaaS or only SaaS.\n\n\n\nWhy\n\nBriefly describe why we are building this capability in the product. What is the vision for this project? Why should ThoughtSpot invest in it? Why will it move the needle?\n\n\n\nWhom (Primary + Secondary Personas)\n\nWhom do we build this product for? What is the one primary persona that this project serves?  Are there any secondary personas that it serves? Most of the workflows in our product have a single primary persona associated with them. Some of our workflows (Monitor, Liveboards) have two personas - one primarily being the creator, the other primarily being the consumer. When relevant, these should be called out explicitly in this section.\n\n\n\nBusiness Case\n\nWhich metric will this move for ThoughtSpot?\n\n\n\nKnown customers that are waiting for this: If we know of specific customers that have asked for this capability (as opposed to it being a generally understood broad ask), we should list them out here. Eg. Citi, BNY Mellon, Capital One, HSBC, Apple.\n\n\n\nCompetitive Outlook\n\nIs this table stakes functionality that the competition generally has, and if so which competitors have it?  Or is this something completely new that ThoughtSpot is introducing?\n\n\n\nDeliver Value/Adoption\n\nWhat will we do to drive Value / Adoption of this feature/product\n\n\n\nAwareness: How will users be aware of this feature? \n\nNeed: When will the user use this feature and how will the user know that? \n\nAre aware of this need of this is a latent need\n\nOld habits: Is this feature replacing an existing behavior? If yes, then how will user stop the existing behavior and use the new feature\n\nCan we interject in the old flow to demonstrate the value of this feature\n\nCapability: What is the user expected to know to use this feature?\n\nHow will internal champions (field folks) learn about this feature\n\nLitmus test: If nobody tells the customer will the customer be able to discover and use the feature as expected?\n\nDetailed Requirements\n\nAll further product requirements that are too granular for the “What” section can go here. Any mocks that exist can also go here. All i18n and l10n specific details should be added here.\n\n\n\nAdditional Considerations\n\nImpact on Mobile\n\nAre there requirements or features that will be launched on Mobile as well, if so please describe the “What’s” for mobile app as well. Work closely with the mobile product owner and the designer to complete this section.\n\n\n\nImpact on TSE\n\nAre there requirements or features that will be launched on TSE as well, if so please describe the “What’s” for TSE as well. Work closely with the TSE product owner and the designer to complete this section. Please include any impact on TSE user flows here e.g. repositioning of a menu item will impact TSE embedded users.\n\n\n\nFor specific guidance, checklist, etc: Planning for TSE in PRDs\n\n\n\nImpact on Orgs\n\nWhat is the implication of this feature on the Org framework. Some of the important aspects to consider are below\n\nWill this have any impact on the admin panel/application ? \n\nWill it be configured with Cluster-wide scope or with Org-only scope\n\nHow will this feature affect Embedded/Enterprise customer who have a cluster configured with multiple Orgs in them\n\nHow will it impact Team Edition/ Pro edition customers who have only one Org assigned to them\n\n\n\nSecurity and Data Privacy\n\nThis sheet contains information about how we collect data. Each row is a type and method of data collection.  We call out which types of data will be collected as part of this project.  If a new type of data will be collected that is not represented in a row in this sheet, then a row must be added to the sheet, which means the following questions must be answered about that row and the legal team notified\n\nWhat data is being collected? Provide a full list of fields and example values. \n\nHow will the data be used?\n\nWhere will data be stored, including country/region?\n\nIs data sent outside of the TSCloud production environment? \n\nWill data be encrypted at rest?\n\nWill data be encrypted in transit?\n\nWho can access data? \n\nHow is access controlled - shared credentials, active-directory, MFA, user from specific department and/or AD group?\n\nHow long will the data be retained?\n\nIs data backed up?\n\nCan this data collection be turned off? Answer should be yes in most cases\n\nIs data stored in a single tenant or multi-tenant environment? How are they isolated? \n\nCan specific customer’s data be deleted if requested?\n\nWill we have an audit log for access to such data?\n\n\n\nNaming & Copy Requirements\n\nNames of features that will probably be used in our release notes or marketing need to be driven by PMM.  Within 30 days after Hard Commit, PMM is responsible for providing names for the features identified by the PM in the PRD.  For example, “Explore”, “Monitor” and “Search on Enter” (aka the absence of “Instant Search”) are all feature names that should be driven by PMM.\n\n\n\nThe copy that will be in the product, but which is not the name of a feature, will be owned and driven by the PM.\n\n\n\nThe PRD should list:\n\nFeature names that are driven by PMM\n\nCopy that is driven by PM\n\n\n\nUser Studies Needed\n\nWhat user studies will need to be performed during this project?  What types of users are needed? (TS employees vs. real TS customers + persona vs. Respondent.io types)\n\n\n\nSaaS vs. Software Enterprise Differences\n\nWhat (if any) differences exist in the functionality to be developed when it is deployed on SaaS vs. when it is part of an Enterprise release\n\n\n\nGCP & AWS \n\nIdeally the feature must be available in both environments and should not have any different. However, if customers are going to experience some difference then this must be documented here. \n\nWhen\n\nRelease Timelines & Phasing\n\nThis section should call out which release we are targeting this feature for. For features that may span multiple releases, this section will specify the chunking of the feature into multiple phases and the desired target release for those chunks (eg. Feature 1.0 Target Rel X, Feature 2.0 Target Release X+1 etc)\n\n\n\nExternal Dependencies & Risks\n\nAre there any factors that might make this project fail that you feel are outside of your control?  How are we mitigating these risks?\n\n\n\nRoll-out Plan\n\nSome projects may not be readily visible and easily testable by many users on Champagne.  For example, Self Serve Upgrade can’t be experienced by many users on Champagne as we don’t upgrade Champagne that often.  For these types of projects, how will we operationalize them in a way that we can ensure quality before they go live.\n\n\n\nDescribe the administrative controls that this feature will need to provide. Example: For IAM, admins should be able to \"Turn off Local Authentication\", and \"Turn on and configure SAML authentication\". These will be made available under the Admin tab-> User Management section.\n\n\n\nSuccess Metrics\n\nSuccess Metrics \n\nWhat is the change in behavior that we expect to see as a result of the functionality in this document?  Weekly Active Users is our north star, but it’s kind of like the hour hand on a clock.  You can stare at it for a long time, but you probably won’t be able to see it move. So, instead we should define success metrics that are like the second hand on a clock that we will see move right away in response to this project if it’s successful. You should have 1 - 3 of these success metrics, but not more.\n\nMixpanel Events\n\nWhat specific Mixpanel events do we need to track to calculate the above success metrics?  Note that we need not track every single possible click and interaction in Mixpanel - we can use Pendo for that.  But the events that we need for the success metrics should be tracked in Mixpanel.\n\n\n\nRequirements Traceability Matrix \n\nBreak up the broad requirements in the PRD into individual requirements which can be mapped to at least one or more EPICS. It should be possible to identify the end to end traceability from PRD to Test cases and release through this table.\n\n\n\nReq #\n\nDescription\n\nJIRA ID\n\nCategory \n\n(Functional, Security)\n\n<Technology>- <Number>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOrgs-001, Orgs-002\n\n\n\nEpic1\n\n\n\n\n\nDocument Control Information\n\nDocument Control\n\nRole\n\nName\n\nTitle\n\nAuthor\n\n\n\n\n\nOwner\n\n\n\n\n\nReviewer\n\n\n\n\n\nApprover\n\n\n\n\n\nRevision History\n\nRevision\n\nDate\n\nWritten/Updated by\n\nSection(s)\n\nSummary\n\n1.0\n\nMMM DD, YYYY\n\n\n\nAll\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReference Documents & Product Reviews\n\nSL #\n\nDocument /Video Title\n\nComments\n\nURL\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

This should either be framed in terms of user actions and expected results or alternatively a logical articulation of the workflows that comprise this feature. The goal of this section is to ensure that if 10 people read this section, they have a reasonably similar understanding of what needs to be built. That is the level of precision that we should be shooting for in this section.</p><p>You can also use this space to describe what is <strong>*not*</strong> in scope. This may be important to ensure the project does not get too large and slip out of the targeted release.</p><p>For mobile team or mobile project:  (a) Version dependency on which cluster version (if not dependent then mention not dependent) (b) Feature available on both on-prem and SaaS or only SaaS.</p><h2><a id=\"_eyiy3fn111k6\"></a>Why</h2><p>Briefly describe why we are building this capability in the product. What is the vision for this project? Why should ThoughtSpot invest in it? Why will it move the needle?</p><h2><a id=\"_qhd9b19xgs16\"></a>Whom (Primary + Secondary Personas)</h2><p>Whom do we build this product for? What is the one primary persona that this project serves?  Are there any secondary personas that it serves? Most of the workflows in our product have a single primary persona associated with them. Some of our workflows (Monitor, Liveboards) have two personas - one primarily being the creator, the other primarily being the consumer. When relevant, these should be called out explicitly in this section.</p><h2><a id=\"_acqgma4s9adm\"></a>Business Case</h2><p>Which metric will this move for ThoughtSpot?</p><p><strong>Known customers that are waiting for this:</strong> If we know of specific customers that have asked for this capability (as opposed to it being a generally understood broad ask), we should list them out here. Eg. Citi, BNY Mellon, Capital One, HSBC, Apple.</p><h2><a id=\"_rrea7uqlpqgh\"></a>Competitive Outlook</h2><p>Is this table stakes functionality that the competition generally has, and if so which competitors have it?  Or is this something completely new that ThoughtSpot is introducing?</p><h2><a id=\"_f050c77k50w5\"></a>Deliver Value/Adoption</h2><p>What will we do to drive Value / Adoption of this feature/product</p><ul><li>Awareness: How will users be aware of this feature? </li><li>Need: When will the user use this feature and how will the user know that? <ul><li>Are aware of this need of this is a latent need</li></ul></li><li>Old habits: Is this feature replacing an existing behavior? If yes, then how will user stop the existing behavior and use the new feature<ul><li>Can we interject in the old flow to demonstrate the value of this feature</li></ul></li><li>Capability: What is the user expected to know to use this feature?</li><li>How will internal champions (field folks) learn about this feature</li><li>Litmus test: If nobody tells the customer will the customer be able to discover and use the feature as expected?</li></ul><h1><a id=\"_wsv5xktmeord\"></a>Detailed Requirements</h1><p>All further product requirements that are too granular for the “What” section can go here. Any mocks that exist can also go here. All i18n and l10n specific details should be added here.</p><h1><a id=\"_b1vjea7as4lc\"></a>Additional Considerations</h1><h2><a id=\"_4ye7oultp4fn\"></a>Impact on Mobile</h2><p>Are there requirements or features that will be launched on Mobile as well, if so please describe the “What’s” for mobile app as well. Work closely with the mobile product owner and the designer to complete this section.</p><h2><a id=\"_pd3u219hqvpx\"></a>Impact on TSE</h2><p>Are there requirements or features that will be launched on TSE as well, if so please describe the “What’s” for TSE as well. Work closely with the TSE product owner and the designer to complete this section. Please include any impact on TSE user flows here e.g. repositioning of a menu item will impact TSE embedded users.</p><p>For specific guidance, checklist, etc: <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/18D8fDLHfPf-3eZVqjP393BxbNrkPKmLgevvyg6C_Fg8/edit#heading=h.9eo2w0pki4tg\">Planning for TSE in PRDs</a></p><h2><a id=\"_fja2gsvrj89g\"></a>Impact on Orgs</h2><p>What is the implication of this feature on the Org framework. Some of the important aspects to consider are below</p><ul><li>Will this have any impact on the admin panel/application ? </li><li>Will it be configured with Cluster-wide scope or with Org-only scope</li><li>How will this feature affect Embedded/Enterprise customer who have a cluster configured with multiple Orgs in them</li><li>How will it impact Team Edition/ Pro edition customers who have only one Org assigned to them</li></ul><h2><a id=\"_kymu309zvzm4\"></a>Security and Data Privacy</h2><p><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HnvfwYgz2J4t9DVdjDSZQ7y2-2_Pi7Rs3XkpQZa4PLM/edit#gid=0\">This sheet</a> contains information about how we collect data. Each row is a type and method of data collection.  We call out which types of data will be collected as part of this project.  If a new type of data will be collected that is not represented in a row in this sheet, then a row must be added to the sheet, which means the following questions must be answered about that row and the legal team notified</p><ul><li>What data is being collected? Provide a full list of fields and example values. </li><li>How will the data be used?</li><li>Where will data be stored, including country/region?</li><li>Is data sent outside of the TSCloud production environment? </li><li>Will data be encrypted at rest?</li><li>Will data be encrypted in transit?</li><li>Who can access data? </li><li>How is access controlled - shared credentials, active-directory, MFA, user from specific department and/or AD group?</li><li>How long will the data be retained?</li><li>Is data backed up?</li><li>Can this data collection be turned off? Answer should be yes in most cases</li><li>Is data stored in a single tenant or multi-tenant environment? How are they isolated? </li><li>Can specific customer’s data be deleted if requested?</li><li>Will we have an audit log for access to such data?</li></ul><h2><a id=\"_45u3xanrj6lj\"></a>Naming &amp; Copy Requirements</h2><p>Names of features that will probably be used in our release notes or marketing need to be driven by PMM.  Within 30 days after Hard Commit, PMM is responsible for providing names for the features identified by the PM in the PRD.  For example, “Explore”, “Monitor” and “Search on Enter” (aka the absence of “Instant Search”) are all feature names that should be driven by PMM.</p><p>The copy that will be in the product, but which is not the name of a feature, will be owned and driven by the PM.</p><p>The PRD should list:</p><ul><li>Feature names that are driven by PMM</li><li>Copy that is driven by PM</li></ul><h2><a id=\"_kkh0xh8a3uhy\"></a>User Studies Needed</h2><p>What user studies will need to be performed during this project?  What types of users are needed? (TS employees vs. real TS customers + persona vs. Respondent.io types)</p><h2><a id=\"_uo00sdh1gyrj\"></a>SaaS vs. Software Enterprise Differences</h2><p>What (if any) differences exist in the functionality to be developed when it is deployed on SaaS vs. when it is part of an Enterprise release</p><h2><a id=\"_2cuk6xw91evr\"></a>GCP &amp; AWS </h2><p>Ideally the feature must be available in both environments and should not have any different. However, if customers are going to experience some difference then this must be documented here. </p><h1><a id=\"_w70hf8l85ry0\"></a>When</h1><h2><a id=\"_u2jaaw26sjjb\"></a>Release Timelines &amp; Phasing</h2><p>This section should call out which release we are targeting this feature for. For features that may span multiple releases, this section will specify the chunking of the feature into multiple phases and the desired target release for those chunks (eg. Feature 1.0 Target Rel X, Feature 2.0 Target Release X+1 etc)</p><h2><a id=\"_1vaoytokiyb9\"></a>External Dependencies &amp; Risks</h2><p>Are there any factors that might make this project fail that you feel are outside of your control?  How are we mitigating these risks?</p><h2><a id=\"_gr285wn4qesi\"></a>Roll-out Plan</h2><p>Some projects may not be readily visible and easily testable by many users on Champagne.  For example, Self Serve Upgrade can’t be experienced by many users on Champagne as we don’t upgrade Champagne that often.  For these types of projects, how will we operationalize them in a way that we can ensure quality before they go live.</p><p>Describe the administrative controls that this feature will need to provide. Example: For IAM, admins should be able to \"Turn off Local Authentication\", and \"Turn on and configure SAML authentication\". These will be made available under the Admin tab-&gt; User Management section.</p><h1><a id=\"_tcrxxpyqgp4e\"></a>Success Metrics</h1><h2><a id=\"_j4c44wtrzw63\"></a>Success Metrics </h2><p>What is the change in behavior that we expect to see as a result of the functionality in this document?  Weekly Active Users is our north star, but it’s kind of like the hour hand on a clock.  You can stare at it for a long time, but you probably won’t be able to see it move. So, instead we should define success metrics that are like the second hand on a clock that we will see move right away in response to this project if it’s successful. You should have 1 - 3 of these success metrics, but not more.</p><h2><a id=\"_us783ibpj6ow\"></a>Mixpanel Events</h2><p>What specific Mixpanel events do we need to track to calculate the above success metrics?  Note that we need not track every single possible click and interaction in Mixpanel - we can use Pendo for that.  But the events that we need for the success metrics should be tracked in Mixpanel.</p><h1><a id=\"_jcnhzaatrni8\"></a></h1><h1><a id=\"_ki2dh95yq9ir\"></a>Requirements Traceability Matrix </h1><p>Break up the broad requirements in the PRD into individual requirements which can be mapped to at least one or more EPICS. It should be possible to identify the end to end traceability from PRD to Test cases and release through this table.</p><table><thead><tr><th><p><strong>Req #</strong></p></th><th><p><strong>Description</strong></p></th><th><p><strong>JIRA ID</strong></p></th><th><p><strong>Category </strong></p><p><strong>(Functional, Security)</strong></p></th></tr><tr><th><p>&lt;Technology&gt;- &lt;Number&gt;</p></th><th></th><th></th><th></th></tr><tr><th><p>Orgs-001, Orgs-002</p></th><th></th><th><p>Epic1</p></th><th></th></tr></thead></table><h1><a id=\"_3j2qqm3\"></a>Document Control Information</h1><h2><a id=\"_1y810tw\"></a>Document Control</h2><table><thead><tr><th><p><strong>Role</strong></p></th><th><p><strong>Name</strong></p></th><th><p><strong>Title</strong></p></th></tr><tr><th><p><strong>Author</strong></p></th><th></th><th></th></tr><tr><th><p><strong>Owner</strong></p></th><th></th><th></th></tr><tr><th><p><strong>Reviewer</strong></p></th><th></th><th></th></tr><tr><th><p><strong>Approver</strong></p></th><th></th><th></th></tr></thead></table><h2><a id=\"_c7pu6gohl3hw\"></a>Revision History</h2><table><thead><tr><th><p><a id=\"_2xcytpi\"></a><strong>Revision</strong></p></th><th><p><strong>Date</strong></p></th><th><p><strong>Written/Updated by</strong></p></th><th><p><strong>Section(s)</strong></p></th><th><p><strong>Summary</strong></p></th></tr><tr><th><p>1.0</p></th><th><p>MMM DD, YYYY</p></th><th></th><th><p>All</p></th><th></th></tr><tr><th></th><th></th><th></th><th></th><th></th></tr></thead></table><h2><a id=\"_c51oda6itiul\"></a>Reference Documents &amp; Product Reviews</h2><table><thead><tr><th><p><strong>SL #</strong></p></th><th><p><strong>Document /Video Title</strong></p></th><th><p><strong>Comments</strong></p></th><th><p><strong>URL</strong></p></th></tr><tr><th></th><th></th><th></th><th></th></tr></thead></table><p><a id=\"_z337ya\"></a></p>",
